16. Alibaba

You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

``` sql
SELECT
  ROUND(
    SUM(item_count::DECIMAL * order_occurrences)
    /SUM(order_occurrences)
    , 1) AS mean
FROM
  items_per_order
;
```


15. JPMorgan

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card, and to gain some insights, you're analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.
Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of issued cards between the month with the highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance. Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

``` sql
SELECT
  card_name,
  MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount) AS difference
FROM
  monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY
  card_name
ORDER BY
  difference DESC
;
```


14. IBM

IBM is analyzing how their employees are utilizing the Db2 database by tracking the SQL queries executed by their employees. The objective is to generate data to populate a histogram that shows the number of unique queries run by employees during the third quarter of 2023 (July to September). Additionally, it should count the number of employees who did not run any queries during this period.

Display the number of unique queries as histogram categories, along with the count of employees who executed that number of unique queries.

``` sql
WITH query_count AS (
SELECT
  employee_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT query_id) AS total_queries
FROM
  queries
WHERE
  query_starttime >= '2023-07-01T00:00:00Z'
  AND query_starttime < '2023-10-01T00:00:00Z'
GROUP BY
  employee_id
ORDER BY
  total_queries DESC
)

SELECT
  COALESCE(total_queries, '0') AS unique_queries,
  COUNT(COALESCE(total_queries, '0')) AS employee_count
FROM
  employees
LEFT JOIN
  query_count ON employees.employee_id = query_count.employee_id
GROUP BY
  unique_queries
ORDER BY
  unique_queries
;
```


13. TikTok

Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.

Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.

``` sql
SELECT
  user_id
FROM
  emails
INNER JOIN
  texts ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id
WHERE
  DATE_PART('day', action_date - signup_date) = 1
  AND texts.signup_action = 'Confirmed'
;
```


12. Facebook

Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note: Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions. To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

``` sql
SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND((100.0*SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) /
  (SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)), 2) AS ctr
FROM
  events
WHERE
  EXTRACT(year FROM timestamp) = 2022
GROUP BY
  app_id;
```


11. FAANG

Companies often perform salary analyses to ensure fair compensation practices. One useful analysis is to check if there are any employees earning more than their direct managers.
As a HR Analyst, you're asked to identify all employees who earn more than their direct managers. The result should include the employee's ID and name.

``` sql
SELECT 
  emp.employee_id AS employee_id, 
  emp.name AS employee_name 
FROM 
  employee AS mgr 
INNER JOIN
  employee AS emp ON mgr.employee_id = emp.manager_id 
WHERE 
  emp.salary > mgr.salary;
```


10. Amazon

Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. The output should display the month as a numerical value, product ID, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output first by month and then by product ID.

``` sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM submit_date) AS submit_month, 
  product_id, 
  ROUND(AVG(stars), 2) AS rounded_stars 
FROM 
  reviews 
GROUP BY 
  submit_month, 
  product_id 
ORDER BY 
  submit_month ASC, 
  product_id ASC;
```


9. Robinhood

Assume you're given the tables containing completed trade orders and user details in a Robinhood trading system.

Write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order. Output the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.

``` sql
SELECT 
  city, 
  count(status) AS total_orders 
FROM 
  trades 
JOIN
  users ON trades.user_id = users.user_id 
WHERE 
  status = 'Completed' 
GROUP BY 
  city 
ORDER BY 
  total_orders DESC 
LIMIT 
  3;
```


8. LinkedIn

Assume you're given a table containing job postings from various companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to retrieve the count of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Definition: Duplicate job listings are defined as two job listings within the same company that share identical titles and descriptions.

``` sql
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT 
    count(title) AS same_job 
  FROM 
    job_listings 
  GROUP BY 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description
)

SELECT 
  count(same_job) AS duplicate_companies 
FROM 
  duplicates 
WHERE 
  same_job > 1;
```


7. Microsoft

Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

Assumption: No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.

``` sql
SELECT 
  sender_id, 
  COUNT(message_id) AS total_messages 
FROM 
  messages 
WHERE 
  sent_date BETWEEN '08/01/2022' AND '08/31/2022' 
GROUP BY 
  sender_id 
ORDER BY 
  total_messages DESC 
LIMIT 
  2;
```


6. Facebook

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

``` sql
SELECT 
  user_id, 
  EXTRACT(days FROM max(post_date) - min(post_date)) AS days_between 
FROM 
  posts 
WHERE 
  post_date BETWEEN '01/01/2021' and '12/31/2021' 
GROUP BY 
  user_id 
HAVING 
  COUNT(post_id) > 1;
```


5. NY Times

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as laptop_reviews and the total viewership for mobile devices as mobile_views.

``` sql
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views 
FROM 
  viewership;
```

``` sql
SELECT 
  part, 
  assembly_step 
FROM 
  parts_assembly 
WHERE 
  finish_date IS NULL;
```
